## Core Concepts

### Commoners -> New Faction
- Not a faction yet as far as others are concerned
- What can a Game-like approach add to this mix?
- Generate out of the box thinking

### World Context
- World says - you can buy places, business negotiations… what else?
- Mix of mythology and real life
- Ritualistic elements
- Game can be an instrument of coming up with different kinds of operations

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Lack cultural, social capital
- Use the map and the instrument that it brings
- With projections, pieces, take snapshots of people and locations
- Turn them into physical cards (ahem)
- Out of the box moves in the valley
- Attracting games more permanently

---

## Map & Visualization

### Map as Instrument
- Map as visualization with real riddles, prompts to go out
- Map view in map room
- Projection numbers 1-50
- Physical book with quests
- Groups of people come here, mark places where things are playable
- Add things as they come in into the game
- War game ops do work like this

## Development Phases

### MVP: Minimalist Place
- Interesting game is developing
- Interesting material -> the reason they engage
- Hero's call
- Game commonalized in some form
- Take place in 3D printing from form

### Phase of Collecting Tools
- Gathering tools
- People help us surface which tools we end up using
- Open call to action
- Get involved to help shape the game, and thus our village

## Key Questions

**What can we offer to the village?**

This question remains open and should be explored through Socratic dialogue.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Game as Instrument:** The game is a tool for generating new forms of operations
2. **Physical-Digital Bridge:** Map, cards, projections connect digital and physical
3. **Community-Driven:** People mark places, add quests, surface tools
4. **Ritualistic Elements:** Mix of mythology and real life
5. **Out of the Box Thinking:** Generate unconventional approaches
6. **Commonalization:** Game becomes shared resource, common good
7. **One Question at a Time:** Always ask only one question per response to maintain focus and allow for deeper exploration

## Implementation Notes

- Map room with projections
- Physical cards from snapshots
- Quest book (numbers 1-50)
- 3D printing integration
- Tool collection phase
- Open call to action for participation

**Note for Game Master:** Use these concepts to guide Socratic questions, but never lecture. Probe with questions that help participants discover these connections themselves. **CRITICAL: Ask only one question at a time** - this maintains focus, allows for deeper exploration, and prevents overwhelming participants with multiple prompts.
